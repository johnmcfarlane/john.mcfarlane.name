<h3 class="project_title">Dodgems: Evolved behaviour</h3>
<p>
	Dodgems is a project I wrote at University whilst exploring the wonders of Microsoft Visual C++ (now Visual Studio.NET).
	The subjects of the simulation are animats (artifical animals) names dodgems. 
	Dodgems have rudimentary sensory and locomotive abilities which are hooked up to a neural network which acts like a brain.

<p>
	When dodgems collide, they exchange energy. 
	When a dodgem runs out of energy, it dies.
	When a dodgem dies, it is replaced with a new dodgem.
	The new dodgem inherits characteristics from two randomly chosen dodgems.
	In this way, dodgems are encouraged to evolve behaviour which causes them to preserve energy by colliding with other dodgems in the right way.
