<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Early Years</h2>

<p class="proper">I was born in England in 1973 and grew up near the village of <span class="proper">Shirenewton</span> in <span class="proper">South East Wales</span>.</p>

<p>My first computer arrived in 1984 and was a <span class="proper">BBC Micro B</span>. 
Very soon, I was teaching myself <span class="proper">BASIC</span> and <span class="proper">8086 assembler</span> from books and magazines and was greatly inspired by computer games such as <span class="proper">Elite</span> and <span class="proper">Repton</span>.</p>

<p>By the time I left school, I was writing in <span class="proper">C</span> and <span class="proper">80286 assembler</span> on a deafeningly loud Amstrad PC with a 28K modem and a SoundBlaster card. 
(Sadly, most of the noise was not coming from the SoundBlaster.)</p>

<h2>University</h2>

<p>I went on to study <span class="proper">Artificial Intelligence with Psychology</span> at <span class="proper">Middlesex University</span> in North London. 
During this time, I was lucky enough to find a work placement at <span class="proper">Intelligent Research Ltd.</span>, a company specialising in bespoke AI products. 
They furnished me with up-to-date PC hardware with which to write NLP-related programs (and play <span class="proper">Doom</span>).</p>

<p>After graduating, I moved to Brighton to gain a Master's Degree in <span class="proper">Evolutionary and Adaptive Systems</span> from the <span class="proper">University of Sussex</span>. 
While applying for a scholarship from a games company in Cambridge, I attended an interview with a senior developer of an artificial life-based title. 
During this interview, it dawned on me that I knew more about games than my interviewer. 
I decided there and then to get a job as a games programmer.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>Brighton was such a fun place to live that I decided to stick around and worked at various games companies in the area. 
For a few years, I was torn away from Brighton to seek work in Guildford which is where I met my future wife, Heather, who was studying in at <span class="proper">UCL</span> at the time.
I moved back to Brighton with her in the spring of 2006 and in the Autumn, she returned to the USA and her home state of Arizona. </p>

<h2>Emigration</h2>

<p>This year, I have followed Heather across the pond and in May, we were wed in <span class="proper">Las Vegas</span>. 
Our first child is due in early October and I am currently in the process of becomming a permanent resident of the United States.
My work permit arrived recently and I am currently looking for a suitable progamming position.</p>
