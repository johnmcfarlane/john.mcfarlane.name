<h3 class="project_title">Web Authoring - (this)</h3>
<p>	This site is my home on the web.
	It usually gets a makeover at times when I'm job hunting but it also teaches me how to write web pages, how to write scripts and how things like <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">xml</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">css</a> work.
	I like to keep my site <a href="http://www.useit.com/">simple</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/">standards compliant</a>.</p>

<p>	Learning to write web pages is pretty easy compared to programming and every page on the internet provides an example of how it's done.
	(Just right-click and select the 'View Source' option so see what a page is made of.)
	A pretty good place to start is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a> although it's a bit heavy on the adverts.
	Just for you, here's a <a href="blank.xhtml">blank page</a> to get you started!</p>

<p>	Until last year, I hosted my site on a home PC running the <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache</a> web server but decided that this was too much hastle for someone who doesn't even have a static IP address.
	Now I use Apache at home only to test the PHP scripts that hold my web pages together.</p>

<p>	When I get the opportunity, I build sites for <a href="../jazzchef">friends</a> and <a href="http://www.thecayo.com/">family</a>.</p>
