<h3 class="project_title">Real-Time Ray Tracing</h3>
<p>
	I have a long history of cornering graphics programmers at parties and talk at them about ray tracers.
	Read a typical (but largely dated) rant on the subject and marvel at the gawky output from <a href="rtrt/">my last ray tracer</a> (for Windows).
