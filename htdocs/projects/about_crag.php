<h3 class="project_title">Crag - Real-time Fractal Landscape Generator</h3>

<p>This is a long-term project to simulate planetary bodies down to fine detail in real-time.
It's also a place for me to experiment with AI, C++, OpenGL and development skills in general.</p>

<p>Crag is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/crag">GitHub</a> and includes downloads for Android and Windows as well as instructions for building on Linux and Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>A very rough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Native_Client">PNaCL</a> prototype for Chrome is available <a href="../crag/">here</a>.</p>
